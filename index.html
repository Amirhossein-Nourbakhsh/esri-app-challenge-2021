									<h2>Health Equality</h2>
									<p>Equality is eliminating the differences among groups of people. These groups can be defined based on their gender, economical, demographical, or geographical status. Health inequalities concern health factors and access to the resources required to improve and maintain health. They also involve a failure to avoid or overcome inequalities that infringe on fairness and human rights norms. Enhancing health equities is vital because health is a basic human right. Some groups of people are more vulnerable than others when facing health issues. This vulnerability could be a result of some characteristics. </p>

									<h2>Covid19 Immunization Equality</h2>
									<p>Out of all, some common characteristics that increase the vulnerability of people against health issues are age, income, gender, and ethnicity. Considering COVID19 the rate of reported cases varies in different neighbourhoods. Some neighbourhoods have a significantly higher rate of cases than others. If a group of vulnerable people live in the same neighbourhood, the health risk will dramatically be higher compared with the same rate of COVID cases in a low vulnerable neighbourhood. The question is that how we can help to balance this risk (generated by the vulnerability of groups of people and the high rate of COVID cases). </p>

									<h2>Our Solution</h2>
									<p>The solution goes beyond empowering these vulnerable groups through systemic changes, such as law reform or changes in economic or social relationships. Simultaneously, reducing the health issues among these groups of society can be as effective and valuable. One way to do so is to increase the access to maintain health (e.g., immunization clinics). By enhancing health equality that results from differences in facilities that help in maintaining health, we can offer vulnerable groups the opportunity to enjoy life and pursue one's life plans. </p>

											<h3>Our team created a health equality database, organizing the selected resources related to equality criteria and health issues (COVID19 as an ongoing example) available in Toronto.  We organized and cured the Toronto census data including age, gender, income, ethnicity, count of covid cases, location of the immunization clinics, and neighbourhoods. The group of vulnerable people were identified through geospatial analysis (overlaying) of the four selected criteria for vulnerability (age, gender, income, ethnicity). The method for overlaying was on the multicriteria decision-making basis (MCDM), based on which all criteria were brought to an identical unit (percentage). It was through rescaling to percentage, normalization by the maximum value of neighbourhoods.</h3>
